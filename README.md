# Hi, I'm Ala Eddine 👋

I'm a **full‑stack developer** focused on building complete end‑to‑end solutions: modern web and mobile apps, robust backend APIs, IoT systems with Raspberry Pi / Arduino, and applied AI with CNN‑based computer vision.  

- 🔭 I design and develop real‑time applications, dashboards, and automation tools that connect cloud backends with physical hardware.  
- 🤖 I work on computer vision (CNN, face detection, object recognition) and integrate AI models into real products and prototypes.  
- 📡 I connect sensors and actuators to the web using HTTP, MQTT, REST APIs and cloud services (Firebase, real‑time databases, messaging).  
- 📱 I build cross‑platform mobile apps with **Flutter** and native Android (**Java**), including chat apps, IoT dashboards and service apps.  
- 🧩 I apply clean code, OOP, MVC/MVVM architectures and design patterns to keep projects maintainable and scalable.  
- 🌱 Always learning more about distributed systems, MLOps, and how to bring AI and IoT together in real‑world scenarios.
